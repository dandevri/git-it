# Git and GitHub for poets

## 1.1 - Introduction
The history and versions of something you are making is important. Git is used for version control. Keeps track of history. Collaboration. Yes you can use dropbox, google drive. But Git has some special features for code.
* Version Control
* Collaboration

Git is the actual version control software.
Github is a web service. Do git things. (social coding)
Repository is a project. Collection of files.

Commit is like a 'save'. Each commit has a message. Each commit also has a hash.

## 1.2 - Branches
You can branch of to make seperate commits to it. You can merge branch into another one. You can then make a pull request and merge it. Push / Pull.

You make a request to pull changes into master.

## 1.3 - Forks and Pull requests
A bit like clone but that's doesn't cover. It makes a new instance (replica) of the repository. It doesn't mess with the original.

You can make a pull request from a fork. Sending out is pushing. Coming in is pulling.

Even if you're pull request doesn't get accepted, it's still a good thing to make one. It shows that you are active.

## 1.4 - GitHub issues
This is not a git concept, only for github websit itself. Only the owner or the person creating the issue can close it. If it's closed it means that it is resolved. All each issues has ID.

If you use the word fixes inside commit with reference to issue it will be closed.  So you can reference hashes or issues alot and GItHub will do alot of the work for you.

## 1.5 - Intro to the Command Line
Work with git offline, without internet using GitHub. You can use GUI but you can also use it through the command line.

Unix commands can be modified with arguments.

## 1.6 - Cloning Repo and Push / Pull
Every command is prefixed with 'git'. If you want to use git commands, you need to be in a git folder.
Cloning it locally to the computer. Get in on your local machine. Github is ann remote.

## 1.7 - Git init and Git add
Any directory on your computer isn't a git repository. Add command is staging. Add a file to the staging area. If you init locally then there are no remotes.

## 1.8 - GitHub Pages
GitHub pages is static file hosting.

## 1.9 - Resolving Merge Conflicts
Merge conflict. You need to resolve conflicts if people are working on the same file, same lines.

## 1.10 - Git Remotes
Look at the code of a pull request (locally) before you merge it. -v verbose
You can have multiple remotes with different repos. Github is way more visual than Git software.

## 1.12 - GitHub pages
