# Git and GitHub for poets

## 1.1 - Introduction
The history and versions of something you are making is important. Git is used for version control. Keeps track of history. Collaboration. Yes you can use dropbox, google drive. But Git has some special features for code.
* Version Control
* Collaboration

Git is the actual version control software.
Github is a web service. Do git things. (social coding)
Repository is a project. Collection of files.

Commit is like a 'save'. Each commit has a message. Each commit also has a hash.

## 1.2 - Branches
You can branch of to make seperate commits to it. You can merge branch into another one. You can then make a pull request and merge it. Push / Pull.

You make a request to pull changes into master.

## 1.3 - Forks and Pull requests
A bit like clone but that's doesn't cover. It makes a new instance (replica) of the repository. It doesn't mess with the original.

You can make a pull request from a fork. Sending out is pushing. Coming in is pulling.

Even if you're pull request doesn't get accepted, it's still a good thing to make one. It shows that you are active.
