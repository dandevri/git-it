# Mastering Issues

Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub’s tracker is called Issues, and has its own section in every repository.

Milestones, labels, and assignees are great features to filter and categorize issues.

* Milestones are groups of issues that correspond to a project, feature, or time period.
* Labels are a great way to organize different types of issues.
* Each issue can have an assignee — one person that’s responsible for moving the issue forward.

We like to use the /cc syntax (an abbreviation for carbon copy) to include people in issues.

Often times issues are dependent on other issues, or at least relate to them and you’d like to connect the two. You can reference issues by typing in a hashtag plus the issue number.

By prefacing your commits with “Fixes”, “Fixed”, “Fix”, “Closes”, “Closed”, or “Close” when the commit is merged into master, it will also automatically close the issue.
