# Understanding the GitHub Flow
> GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly.

Anything in the master branch is always deployable. Branch name should be descriptive.

Add commits to keep track of progress. Pull Requests are useful for contributing to open source projects and for managing changes to shared repositories.

* Fork and Pull; changes to consider
* Shared Model; start code review 

Pull request can have more commits after they are created.

Merge into master branch. By incorporating certain keywords into the text of your Pull Request, you can associate issues with code.
