# Mastering Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.

These include @mentions as well as references to SHA-1 hashes, Issues, and Pull Requests.
