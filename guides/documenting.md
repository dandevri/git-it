# Documenting your projects on GitHub

 Good documentation is key to the success of any project. Making documentation accessible enables people to learn about a project; making it easy to update ensures that documentation stays relevant.

* readme
* wikis


READMEs generally follow one format in order to immediately orient developers to the most important aspects of your project.

* Project name
* Description
* Table of Contents
* Installation; Tell other users how to install your project locally.
* Usage; instruct other people on how to use your project after theyâ€™ve installed it
* Contributing
* Credits
* License

Every repository on GitHub comes with a wiki. Using the drop-down menu in the editor, you can select the format of your wiki, and then use wiki toolbar to create and include content on a page.
