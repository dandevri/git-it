# Git Handbook

A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together.

Git is an example of a distributed version control system (DVCS) commonly used for open source and commercial software development.allows every user access to a full and self-contained history of all changes.

Or git Project, collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each file’s revision history. The file history appears as snapshots in time called commits. multiple lines of development called branches. 

Because Git is a DVCS, repositories are self-contained units and anyone who owns a copy of the repository can access the entire codebase and its history.

Any changes that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part of the project’s history.

GitHub builds collaboration directly into the developement process. The GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow built around core Git commands.

* Shared repository; With a shared repository, individuals and teams are explicitly designated as contributors with read, write, or administrator access. 
* Fork and pull; For an open source project, or for projects to which anyone can contribute, managing individual permissions can be challenging, but a fork and pull model allows anyone who can view the project to contribute
